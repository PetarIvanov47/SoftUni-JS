                    <h2>Welcome to Azeroth</h2>
                    <p>Azeroth is the name of the world in which the majority of the Warcraft series is set. At its core dwells a slumbering world-soul, the nascent spirit of a titan. Long ago, it was invaded by the Old Gods, eldritch abominations from the Void. When the Pantheon arrived, the titans imprisoned the Old Gods deep beneath the earth, before healing and ordering the world, and seeding life across the planet. A great fount of magic that would nurture the land was placed at the center of Kalimdor, known as the Well of Eternity.</p>
